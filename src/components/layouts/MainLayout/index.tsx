      V3 Pooling is now deprecated and staking here will not earn you any rewards nor will any trades go through these pools. The protocol was upgraded to a newer version with completely new contracts. <br /> 
      While there is no risk to your funds, we recommend you unstake from V3 pools and stake in V4 pools on arbitrum to earn increased yield and earn staking rewards. <br />
      Visit <a href="https://leverage.unidex.exchange/pooling" className="underline">leverage.unidex.exchange/pooling</a> to stake in V4 pools on arbitrum to earn increased yield and earn staking rewards. <br />
